This is a TrueType font file. The included image file is the image I used to hand-craft this font. I've chosen to license this as Public Domain because the previous two people who handled this work did the same. Any attribution should go to Clint Bellanger for the original work found here:

And the altered version by cemkalyoncu found here:

EDIT

usr_share was kind enough to add lowercase letters, found here:
